# Why?

Templates engines like Twig, or Blade are a great thing, really.

However, to use them one needs to learn another *language* with its own syntax and rules.

Moreover, using compiled engines to use even a simple PHP function one needs to write engine extension.

On its side, PHP is already a templating language, but honestly it's not a good one, because it's missing pivotal features of modern template engines, like template inheritance.
